#### Sanskrit syllable length notation

The translation of a Sanskrit treatise about syllable length is using a specific representation of syllable length notation that differs slightly from the Devanagari one:

![syllable length notation](images/metrics.png?raw=true)

(Derge Tengyur, vol. 197, p. 361a et seq.)

In this case, we propose to use the Devanagari equivalents:
- `ऽ` for heavy (`ऽं` when with anusvara)
- `।` for light (`।ं` when with anusvara)

#### Terton marks
