#### Sanskrit syllable length notation

The translation of a Sanskrit treatise about syllable length is using a specific representation of syllable length notation that differs slightly from the Devanagari one:

![syllable length notation](images/metrics.png?raw=true)

(Derge Tengyur, vol. 197, p. 361a et seq.)

In this case, we propose to use the Devanagari equivalents:
- `093D` (ऽ) for heavy syllable (`093D 0902`, ऽं when with anusvara)
- `0964` (।) for light syllable (`0964 0902`, ।ं when with anusvara)
