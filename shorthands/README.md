# Tibetan Shorthands

Tibetan has a tradition of shorthands that are for some part impossible to encode in Unicode. We give a few examples of there here, in the hope that a full database can be created in the future.

Unless indicated otherwise, the images come from vol. 5 of [བླ་མ་དགོངས་འདུས།](http://tbrc.org/link?RID=W23445)

##### ms suffix

![khams](images/khams.jpg?raw=true) is short for ཁམས, the diacritics cannot be encoded


##### ji tar

![ji tar](images/ji-tar.png?raw=true) is short for ཇི་ཏར, it can be encoded as `0F47 0F9F 0F72 0F62` (ཇྟིར)

##### sna tshogs

![sna tshogs](images/sna-tshogs.png?raw=true) is short for སྣ་ཚོགས, it can be encoded as `0F66 0F39 0F53 0F7C 0F4C` (ས༹ནོཌ, likely to be poorly rendered).

Note that here the place of the 0F39 marks is not very clear, `0F66 0F53 0F39 0F7C 0F4C` might be another option.

##### gting nge 'dzin

![gting nge 'dzin](images/gting-nge-hdzin.png?raw=true) is short for གཏིང་ངེ་འཛིན, it can be encoded as `0F4F 0F72 0F39 0F44 0F72 0F7A 0F53` (ཏི༹ངིེན, likely to be poorly rendered).

##### tshogs

This is from the [Lhasa Kangyur](http://tbrc.org/link?RID=W26071), vol. 1, p. 8:

![tshogs](images/tshogs.png?raw=true)

This special form of sbuscript sa is clearly distinct from the regular subscript sa (0FB6) but there is no way to encode this for in Unicode.

##### sems can thams cad

![sems can thams cad](images/sems-can-thams-cad.png?raw=true) is short for སེམས་ཅན་ཐམས་ཅད, in this case the shorthand for མ (in the form of the reverse τ above ཐ) cannot be encoded.
